# Django starter template
A little something-something that I use as my starter template for personal and commercial Django projects.  The basic idea is to save time when starting Django projects - at the beginning of all Django projects I found I always did certain things every single time.

This starter template gives me the opportunity to as quickly as possible get through the boilerplate and start real & interesting work on new DJango projects.

* A context processor to make the site name available to templates (core.context_processors.site_processor)
